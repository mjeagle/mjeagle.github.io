<p>I earned my PhD in Computer Science from North Carolina State University. My main area of research is focused on deriving insight about human behavior using data-driven methods, and using that insight to create new and better systems. I have a specific focus on complex interactive environments, such as video games and intelligent tutoring systems. My PhD advisor was Dr. Tiffany Barnes. I have worked in the Data Science industry for Turbine Inc. and Blizzard Entertainment. I used my human-centered data science expertise to uncover important insights for game designers and marketing teams. </p>

<p>I am interested in video games and tabletop games. I enjoy watching live streams on Twitch.tv, as well as video game content from YouTube. I have combined my passions on several occasions, including performing analysis on data from Twitch streams and building AI for video games.</p>
